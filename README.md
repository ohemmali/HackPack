# UCFHackPack
This code repo will contain code examples of algorithms expected to be in a programming contest hack pack.

Note: This is only intended for reference. I cannot emphasize enough the need to write and test your own code. Using someone else's code that you found online without understanding it's underlying algorithm, limitations, and boundary cases, is very risky during a contest.
